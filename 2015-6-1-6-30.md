This will be my journal for the RubySteps professional developers program.

I somehow neglected to closely record my activity for the past month, but from now on every 45 minute block will be recorded here.  This first entry will be a little bit long: but it will give an idea of what I've been looking at and working on from 6/1 - 7/1.

1) Setting up my Shu Ha Ri on Trello.
	 Added Ruby, Rails, TDD, and Refactoring to the inbox.
	 Ruby moved to WIP.
	 	List: Classes and methods
	 				Object-oriented Programming
	 					-inheritance and mixins
	 				Functional Programming
	 					-blocks
	 					-Procs and lambdas
	 				Flow control
	 					-Conditionals
	 					-Enumerables
	 				REPLs and debugging
	 				Metaprogramming

2) Placed Attributes and methods into SHU
		
		Started using "The Book of Ruby" by Huw Collingbourne as a reference.
			The book breaks down Ruby concepts into very small chunks, which has helped me really get into the meat of the language.  I'm now starting to feel that I'm programming as a process and not based on memorization, or how I remembered how someone else did it before me.  It's a great book, and I highly recommend it to all levels.  Take it step by step.
