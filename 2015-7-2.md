Mini project 2: Shopping for an ingredient for a recipe.  

Ever go to the supermarket bought an ingredient for a recipe you found, and come to find that you just needed a pinch of that ingredient, and now you're left with a ton of it?

This mini project will help you buy just what you need to reduce waste.

Challenge:
1) Buying the right amount of an ingredient for your recipe.
2) Knowing volumes and measures.  Something we'll have to define.
3) Should we buy a lb of butter, or just a 1/4 lb?
4) User enters the amount of butter needed for a recipe.  We'll just do one ingredient for now to make it quick.
5) We'll need an 'if' it is greater, or less than a certain amount we can tell the user how much to buy.
6) Print out our suggestion to the user of what to buy.
7) Butter is available in sticks of 1/4 pound or 4 ounces.

Let's get stuck in.

amount = 0

print "How many ounces of butter do you need for your recipe?"
amount = gets.to_i

if amount > 16 then
	puts "You will need more than a pound of butter."
end
			
if amount >=13 && amount <= 16 then
	puts "You will need four sticks of butter."
end	

if amount <= 12 && amount >= 9 then
	puts "You will need three sticks of butter."	
end
		
if amount <= 8 && amount >= 5 then
	puts "You will need two sticks of butter."									
end

if amount <= 4 then
	puts "You will need one stick of butter."
end
