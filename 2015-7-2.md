Mini project 2: Shopping for an ingredient for a recipe.  

Ever go to the supermarket bought an ingredient for a recipe you found, and come to find that you just needed a pinch of that ingredient, and now you're left with a ton of it?

This mini project will help you buy just what you need to reduce waste.

Challenge:
1) Buying the right amount of an ingredient for your recipe.
2) Knowing volumes and measures.  Something we'll have to define.
3) Should we buy a lb of butter, or just a 1/4 lb?
4) User enters the amount of butter needed for a recipe.  We'll just do one ingredient for now to make it quick.
5) We'll need an 'if' it is greater, or less than a certain amount we can tell the user how much to buy.
6) Print out our suggestion to the user of what to buy.
7) Butter is available in sticks of 1/4 pound or 4 ounces.

Let's get stuck in.

amount = 0

print "How many ounces of butter do you need for your recipe?"
amount = gets.to_i

if amount > 16 then																		#Conditional statement evaluate whether it is true or not.
	puts "You will need more than a pound of butter."
end
			
if amount >=13 && amount <= 16 then
	puts "You will need four sticks of butter."
end	

if amount <= 12 && amount >= 9 then
	puts "You will need three sticks of butter."	
end
		
if amount <= 8 && amount >= 5 then
	puts "You will need two sticks of butter."									
end

if amount <= 4 then
	puts "You will need one stick of butter."
end	

What worked well? 
The basic syntax of using conditionals to evaluate true or false.

What didn't work well?
Mixed up the operators quite a bit, which kind of made me feel like I was going nowhere fast. Especially when it doesn't work for the 100th time.  Instead of keeping it simple, I made the mistake of trying other options, but this solution really is the simplest one.  This is something that if I was pairing with someone wouldn't have been that much of a headache.

Self-Assesment:
Once the operators were in place, it was totally fine.  Keep frustration to a minimum as much as you can.  Getting frustrated does not produce the solutions quickly, it actually hinders it.  Also don't force the issue as well.  Take 15 minutes and do something else, I got out my putter and practiced on my carpet for 10 minutes when in the middle of hitting a putt I figured out the solution.
