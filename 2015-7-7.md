Ok part 2 of movies. Go down to line 31 for continuation.

					movies = {Furious7: 8, Interstellar: 8, Insidious3: 7}  #Hash to hold titles, and rating.

					puts "What would you like to do to your movie list? (add, update, display, or delete)"  #refactored from a puts for each add, update, display, deleted.

					choice = gets.chomp					#chomp returns string method, without it the case conditionals won't return anything.
					case choice									#requires a specific answer from the user.
					when 'add'
						puts "Add a movie title."
						title = gets.chomp
						if movies[title.intern].nil? #.intern is another alias for .to_sym.
						puts "How would you rate it? (Type a number from 0 to 10)"
						rating = gets.chomp
						movies[title.intern] = rating.to_i
						puts "#{title.intern} has been added with a rating of #{rating.to_i}."
						else
						puts "That movie already exists, it's rating is #{movies[title.intern]}"
					end

					when 'update'
						puts "Updated!"
					when 'display'
						puts "My Movies!"
					when 'delete'
						puts "Deleted"
					else
						puts "I don't understand your request."
					end

Let's try and get update, display, and delete fleshed out.

when 'update'
	puts "What movie do you want to update?"
	title = gets.chomp
	if movies[title.to_sym].nil?	#using .to_sym here, it works both ways with .intern and .to_sym. (Why? Not clear.)
		puts "Movie not found!"
	else
		puts "What is the new rating? (Type a number from 0 to 10.)"
		rating = gets.chomp
		movies[title.to_sym] = rating.to_i
		puts "#{title} has been updated with a rating of #{rating}."
	end
when 'display'
	movies.each do |movie, rating|		#this goes back to the hash we created on movies that holds title and rating
	puts "#{movie}: #{rating}"				##{movie}: comes from movies[title.intern], and #{rating} comes from gets.chomp
end

when 'delete'
	puts "What movie do you want to delete?"
	title = gets.chomp
	if movies[title.to_sym].nil?
		puts "Movie is not on your list."
	else
		movies.delete(title.to_sym)
		puts "#{title} has been removed."
	end
else
	puts "I don't understand your request."
end

I'm gonna stop here, and sleep on it for now.

What went well?

I was able to flesh out update, display, and delete ok as I thought.

What didn't go well?

I encountered a number of syntax errors, which I can figure out later.  That being said, I think I'm still thinking about problems that are too large.  They sound small at first, but require A LOT of work.  I'm starting to think that this is the real reality of how PDP works. Which is good!

See you tomorrow.
