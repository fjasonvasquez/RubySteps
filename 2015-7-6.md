Movie Tracker

So now I want to track movies I've seen so far, and record whether it was good or not. We can add movies to a list, update a rating, display what I've seen, and delete an entry.

Challenge:
1) Make an add feature to a list of movies.  Each movie will have a name and a rating(hash).
2) When adding a movie, we need to add a rating.
3) Make an update feature for each movie.
4) Make a display feature to display all entries.
5) Make a delete feature to remove an entry.

Ok, let's see how it goes.

movies = {Furious7: 8, Interstellar: 8, Insidious3: 7}  #Hash to hold titles, and rating.

puts "What would you like to do to your movie list? (add, update, display, or delete)"  #refactored from a puts for each add, update, display, deleted.

choice = gets.chomp					#chomp returns string method, without it the case conditionals won't return anything.
case choice									#requires a specific answer from the user.
when 'add'
	puts "Add a movie title."
	title = gets.chomp
	if movies[title.intern].nil? #.intern is another alias for .to_sym.
	puts "How would you rate it? (Type a number from 0 to 10)"
	rating = gets.chomp
	movies[title.intern] = rating.to_i
	puts "#{title.intern} has been added with a rating of #{rating.to_i}."
	else
	puts "That movie already exists, it's rating is #{movies[title.intern]}"
end

when 'update'
	puts "Updated!"
when 'display'
	puts "My Movies!"
when 'delete'
	puts "Deleted"
else
	puts "I don't understand your request."
end

That's all we have time for now.  I'll continue tomorrow to hopefully finish another feature.

What went well?
Things started to flesh out as I was building the structure of the program, and I got it to respond when asking the user to type in some info.

What didn't go well?
My initial intention seemed small at the time, and as I was going through it.  There were more questions that came up that I didn't think about.  Things like, what if the movie already existed?  Or if the rating was beyond the limit?  So while I thought I was going to get through the project quickly.  It was really only one feature, which isn't bad, but made me think again about how a client may think it's easy, I can now respond that it isn't as easy as you think because of XYZ.

Self Assessment:
It's great to map out a basic skeleton of what a program should do, but detail is soooo important when it comes to building it out.  It's like building a house.
1) Build a foundation.
2) Build a framework.
3) Build electrics, gas, and plumbing.
4) Build walls and cover with a roof.

So many details not covered here, step 1 could require a thousand steps before that could be done, and so on and so on.  So when talking to the customer, no matter how fast they talk, slow them down and brainstorm what really goes into it.
