Simple program

Starting to get the hang of writing my own code using "The Book of Ruby" BOR.

So let's get a tip calculator going.  It's a small and simple program without using any magic from Rails, just plain old Ruby.

So what needs to be done?
1) We need the amount of the bill.  So that will involve a "gets".
2) What percentage tip would the user like to leave? Another "gets".
3) We need to calculate the tip using simple math.

So here we go.

print "Please enter the amount of the bill." 							#prompt for the user
bill_amount = gets.to_f 																	#variable with a gets to float not integer.

print "What percentage would you like to leave?"					#another prompt for the user
tip = gets.to_f / 100																			#variable with a gets to float divided by 100 for "per cent"

puts "Your tip will be: #{bill_amount * tip}"							#interpolation of calculation with a hash.

Pretty simple, but it does work.  

What worked well?  

Thinking out the process for the user and making it into simple steps.  This really helps to break it down, because we all think too big at first, and want to do too much at first.  What this did for me is actually get a small step forward, and know I've completed something quickly.

What didn't work well?

I tried really hard to make this as difficult as possible without knowing it, and once I laid out the problem, and the solution, it really wasn't hard at all, and I was able to make the program work pretty quickly.

Self-Assessment:
Pretty good, stop trying to get in your own way of doing things.  Programming is hard enough, and we don't need to make it any more complicated than it should be.  Address the problem, break it down, and it will be easier than you think.
